Drinks Quality Prediction using ML algorithms:
-----------------------------------------------

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset used for this project is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Project Structure:
--------------------------
Dependencies: Import necessary libraries.
Data Collection: Load and inspect the dataset as given in the repository.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Understand the data through statistical measures and visualizations.
Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between different features.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling.
Label Binarization: Convert the target variable to binary form for classification.
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a Random Forest Classifier on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using accuracy score.
Prediction: Built a predictive system to classify wine quality.

Dependencies:
---------------
The following libraries are used in this project:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

Conclusion:
---------------
The model achieved an accuracy of 92.5% on the test data. This predictive system can help in classifying red wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. Further improvements can be made by exploring different machine learning algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and using more advanced feature engineering techniques.
